I am a full-stack software engineer, former Marine Engineer graduate, and used to work as an Assistant Telecom Planner at M2 Tech. My experience working in M2 Tech with Big Data and Data analysis has fuelled my interest in software engineering.  This encouraged me to start and complete the Maker's Academy boot-camp course for Web Developers in order to start a new career in an ever changing industry. I am looking for a role as a junior/graduate developer with good working environment whilst learning new skills to further develop my career.

#### Practical

I have developed a practical mindset during my engineering studies allowing me to obtain the MVP in a given timeframe. For instance in the project Doocracy initially Angular with ruby on rails was discussed but I convinced that the simpler and clear jQuery was more appropriate for our MVP

#### Fast Learner

In Maker's Academy, I was challenged to learn new skills each week.  In the end I had learned and accumulated numerous skills and techniques in software development.

- Created multiple repos with Angular, Javascript, jQuery, Ruby on Rails during the course
- Able to create Memeories with a variety of new APIs (https://github.com/naridas/Memeories) within 1 week
- Learnt to build yelp-clone with ruby on rails in 1 week

#### Communication

Having lived in the US, Greece and now the UK has given a breadth of experience with a variety of people, and cultures. I excel and enjoy pair programming.  I am able to present and express ideas clearly.

#### Assistant Telecom Planner

Worked together with a Senior Engineer in designing Line of Sight between Base Stations using EE telecom tools and Google Earth. Did data entry related to mobile networks. Involved in database analysis for mobile network and manipulated data to see trends as well as the progress of the expansion & migration of the network. The surveyed hubs deliver Virgin Media or BT connectivity to T-Mobile, Orange and 3 mobile networks. Status could be seen using telecom tools.
