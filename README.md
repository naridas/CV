Aspiring software craftsman who was a former Marine Engineering graduate. Recently completed Maker's Academy course for Web Developers. Looking for a role as a junior developer with good working environment whilst learning new skills like Java to further develop my career.

## <a name="skills">Skills</a>

#### Practical

Coming from an Engineering background, I have a very methodological mindset therefore I first visualise, then see what is needed to create the MVP of that image.  For example in the Final Project (Doocracy), my group discussed using Angular with Ruby on Rails which I stated the pros and cons of using it, then pushed forward for using jQuery instead for our MVP since it is easier to implment, therefore making our MVP feasible within our timeframe.

#### Fast Learner

Learning in Maker's Academy constantly puts pressure on me to learn new skills quickly since they introduce something newto learn each week.

- Created multiple repos in various languages during the course
- Able to create Memeories with a variety of new APIs (https://github.com/naridas/Memeories) within 1 week

#### Communication

Having lived in the US, Greece and now the UK has given a breadth of experience with a variety of people, and cultures. Throughout the course I enjoyed pairing with everyone in my cohort and group projects.  I believe this is due to my ability to adapt to variety of social situations and also encourage a good working environment.
