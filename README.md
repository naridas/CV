Aspiring software engineer who was a former Marine Engineer graduate. Recently completed Maker's Academy boot-camp course for Web Developers in order to start a new career due to wanting to work in an ever changing industry and my enjoyment from building computers. Looking for a role as a junior developer with good working environment whilst learning new skills like Java to further develop my career.

#### Practical

Coming from an Engineering background, I have a methodological mindset therefore think what do I want the code to do, afterwards what do I need to do to get the MVP.  For example in the Final Project (Doocracy), my group discussed using Angular with Ruby on Rails which I suggested using jQuery instead for our MVP since it is easier to implement. Since we are more knowledgable regarding it, but also a variety of teams had problems combining them previously therefore personally preferred we had something that worked for our MVP then later on implement Angular.

#### Fast Learner

Learning in Maker's Academy constantly challenged me to learn new skills quickly since they introduce something new to learn each week.

- Created multiple repos with Angular, Javascript, jQuery, Ruby on Rails during the course
- Able to create Memeories with a variety of new APIs (https://github.com/naridas/Memeories) within 1 week
- Learnt to build yelp-clone with ruby on rails in 1 week

#### Communication

Having lived in the US, Greece and now the UK has given a breadth of experience with a variety of people, and cultures. Throughout the course I enjoyed pair programming everyday with my cohort and working in group projects.  I believe this is partially due to my ability to adapt to variety of social situations and also encourage a good working environment.

#### Assistant Telecom Planner

Worked together with a Senior Engineer in designing Line of Sight between Base Stations using EE telecom tools & Google Earth. Did data entry related to mobile networks. Involved in database analysis for mobile network and manipulated data to see trends as well as the progress of the expansion & migration of the network. The surveyed hubs deliver Virgin Media or BT connectivity to T-Mobile, Orange and 3 mobile networks. Status could be seen using telecom tools.
